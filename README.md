# My Notes

This web application allows users to create, manage, and view their personal notes securely. Each user's notes are private, ensuring that even if someone else knows the ID of a note, they cannot access or manage it. The application is built using the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire), providing a modern and dynamic user experience.
